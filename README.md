**Sudoku Solver**
**Overview**
This Python program implements a Sudoku Solver using backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular puzzle game that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The Sudoku Solver program takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and finds a solution that satisfies all the rules of Sudoku. It utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all possible solutions, efficiently pruning branches that violate the Sudoku rules.

**DSA Strategies Used**
1. **Backtracking Algorithm**: The program utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to explore all possible solutions for the Sudoku puzzle. It systematically fills in empty cells, backtracking when a dead-end is reached, until a valid solution is found.

2. **Data Structures:** The program uses a two-dimensional array to represent the Sudoku grid, making it efficient to access and manipulate cells during the solving process. Additionally, it employs recursion to implement the backtracking algorithm effectively.

**Features**
1. Solves Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulty levels.
2. Handles both well-formed and invalid Sudoku puzzles gracefully.
3. Provides a clear and concise output displaying the solved Sudoku grid.

**Usage**
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version 3.x).
3. Run the Sudoku_Solver.ipynb with the unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input.
4. The program will output the solved Sudoku grid to the console.
